# Caffein-Consumption-Analysis
## Is the amount of caffeine you are consuming considered safe?
   This repository contains a Power BI dashboard that helps you analyze the amount of caffeine in your favorite coffee products. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, healthy adults can consume up to 400 milligrams of caffeine per day.

Using data from various coffee shops, I analyzed the amount of caffeine in different coffee products. On Power BI, I performed what-if analysis to slice data by the number of coffee cups.

The analysis shows that to achieve a maximum intake of 400mg of caffeine, different coffee products from coffee shops cap at a different number of coffee cups as summarized in the table below:

This table summarizes the caffeine content per cup and the maximum number of coffee cups one can consume to achieve a daily caffeine intake of 400mg for different coffee products.

Feel free to explore the Power BI dashboard and see how the analysis was performed. If you have any questions or feedback, please let me know.
